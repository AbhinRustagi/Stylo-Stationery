### Running the project

To run the project, install Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
To check if node has been installed successfully, run the command ```node --version```, if it does give the version you installed, node has been successfully installed. If not, reinstall node and go through the setup.

Now cd into the directory "stylo-stationery" and run ```npm i``` (this command will install all the dependencies).
Now install nodemon (npm package which helps to automatically restart the server upon changing the code) but you will have to refresh localhost:3000 each time you make changes but will not be required to rerun the server. Install nodemon [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)

Now staying in the parent directory, run ```npm start```, this will start the server and will show "Server started on port 3000" on the terminal.
Open localhost to see the project [here](http://localhost:3000/).

### Dependencies
This project relies heavily on the following ```npm``` packages:
- ```express```
- ```ejs```
- ```body-parser```
